# Sauce Orchestrate ImageRunner Examples

Sauce Orchestrate is a new and unique approach to web and mobile application testing that increases test execution speed
and enables end-to-end test orchestration.

ImageRunner is a way of running tests within Sauce Orchestrate, where you build a Docker image with your tests yourself,
and we execute it within our infrastructure for you.
